# Kahoot-Bot
This is a Kahoot Bot in JS that I made and you can actually input your answers into the bot so it can answer correctly!

# Imported from My Replit!

# To Use
first run this in your cmd / terminal "npm install kahoot.js-updated@2.4.0" without the quotations.
than run "node index.js" without the qoutations to start the bot.

# Requirements
Node JS

# Have Fun, but do note that you should not abuse this and only use it for educational purposes!
